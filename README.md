This repository contains LaTeX sources of my resume which is based on a modified
version of [ModernCV](https://github.com/xdanaux/moderncv) template.

The output is frequently uploaded to my personal web page and can be found
[there](https://kirillbobyrev.github.io/resources/Resume-Kirill-Bobyrev.pdf).
