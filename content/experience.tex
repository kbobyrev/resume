      \begin{cvitems}
        \item Significantly improved \link{Clangd}{https://clangd.llvm.org/},
          Clang-based C++ Language Server Protocol implementation for Visual
          Studio Code, Vim, CLion, XCode, Eclipse, a number of other IDEs and
          text editor plugins.
        \item Implemented Remote Index service that provides an index for LLVM
          and Chrome. This allows developers with slow machines to get
          precise code completion and navigation for these large projects.
        \item Took responsibilities of Product Manager and User Experience
          Researcher: continuously interviewed our users and processed feedback,
          built feature roadmaps and prioritized tasks based on the needs of our
          users.

      \begin{cvitems}
        \item Implemented state-of-the-art Deep Learning models for Optical
          Character Recognition in PyTorch and TensorFlow.
        \item Secured a contract with AMG Mercedes Benz, worked out how to
          translate their business goals into fine-grained technical problems
          and led the project.
        \item Built Deep Learning models for a our clients' variety of tasks
          such as Image and Sound Segmentation, Image Classification and Video
          Fraud Detection.

      \begin{cvitems}
        \item Designed and implemented
          \link{Dex}{https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C-A6PGT6TynyaX4PXyExNMiGmJ2jL1UwV91Kyx11gOI/edit?usp=sharing}
          --- efficient Clangd symbol index for fuzzy matching code completion
          based on Russ Cox
          \link{design}{https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp4.html} of Google
          Code Search.
        \item Replaced previous Static Index implementation and gained over
          \textbf{15x performance boost} while providing more features such as
          advanced filtering for code completion-based symbol search.
        \item Reduced code completion average latency from \SI{16}{\us} to
          \SI{1.09}{\us} for LLVM codebase (3M Lines Of Code) and from
          \SI{119}{\us} to \SI{1.9}{\us} for Chromium codebase (16M LOC).
        \item Implemented Variable length Byte (VByte) compression algorithm
          and reduced memory overhead by 60\% with insignificant loss of
          speed and no precision loss.
        \item Identified performance bottlenecks in commonly used LLVM YAML
          serializer and made it 3 times faster.

      \begin{cvitems}
        \item Elevated performance of
        \link{Clang-Rename}{https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-rename.html},
          Clang-based tool that can perform efficient renaming actions in
          large-scale projects such as renaming classes, functions,
          variables, arguments, namespaces etc.
        \item Fixed inconsistent renaming bugs, added support for template
          classes, introduced new functionality and gained users for
          Clang-Rename.
        \item Built Vim and Emacs plugins for Clang-Rename tool.
        \item Designed and prototyped
          \link{Clang-Refactor}{https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w9IkR0_Gqmd5w4CZ2t_ZDZrNLYVirQPyMS41533HQZE/edit?usp=sharing},
          which later transformed into
          \link{Clang's Refactoring Engine}{https://clang.llvm.org/docs/RefactoringEngine.html}
        \item Started a discussion about building Language Server Protocol
          implementation which later resulted in Clangd creation and became the
          main focus of the team.
        \item Added new checks to
          \link{Clang-Tidy}{https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/} and
          reduced false-positive rate for existing ones.
