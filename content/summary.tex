\cvsection{Summary}

\begin{cvparagraph}
I am Software Engineer at Google and work on
  \link{clangd}{https://clangd.llvm.org}, C++ Language Server implementation
that brings IDE experience to Visual Studio Code, Vim and other editors. I
contribute to \link{LLVM}{https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project} very often
(\link{list}{https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commits?author=kirillbobyrev}
of commits). I specialize in Compilers and Machine Learning. C++, Rust and
Python are typically my languages of choice.
