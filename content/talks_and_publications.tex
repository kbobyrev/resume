        \item Dex is the new Clangd symbol index design and implementation
          which is the backbone for such features as the global code
          completion. The proposed index design allows efficient symbol
          retrieval based on a wide range of metrics such as fuzzy matching.
          Dex is designed to serve small to medium size projects including LLVM
          and Chromium with high code completion quality and without noticeable
          latency. We would like to share the experience building the new index
          and outline the vast range of potential improvements for performance
          and quality optimization.
