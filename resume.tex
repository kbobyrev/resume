\section{Education}
  \cventry{Class of 2019}{BSc}{Russia}{Moscow Institute of Physics and
    Technology}{Applied Mathematics and Physics}{}

\section{Experience}
  \cventry{2018}{Software Engineering Intern}
    {Google}{}{C++ Language Tools Team}
    {Worked on Clangd, Clang-based C++ LSP implementation used by CLion, XCode,
     Eclipse and other IDEs
     \begin{itemize}
       \item Designed and implemented
         \href{https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C-A6PGT6TynyaX4PXyExNMiGmJ2jL1UwV91Kyx11gOI/edit?usp=sharing}
         {\textcolor{blue}{Dex}} --- efficient Clangd symbol index for fuzzy
         matching code completion.
       \item Replaced previous Static Index implementation and gained over
         15x performance boost while providing more features for code
         completion-based symbol search.
       \item New index implementation reduced code completion symbol search
         average latency from 16 ms to 1.09 ms for LLVM codebase (3M Lines Of
         Code) and 119 ms to 1.9 ms for Chromium codebase (16M LOC).
       \item Identified performance bottlenecks in commonly used LLVM YAML
         serializer and improved performance by a factor of 3.
     \end{itemize}}
  \cventry{2016}{Software Engineering
    Intern}{Google}{}{C++ Language Tools Team}{
    Worked on Clang-Rename, Clang-based tool for renaming symbols such as
    variables, functions, arguments.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Fixed a number of existing issues, introduced new functionality
        and gained users for Clang-Rename.
      \item Built Vim and Emacs integration for Clang-Rename tool.
      \item Designed and prototyped
        \href{https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w9IkR0_Gqmd5w4CZ2t_ZDZrNLYVirQPyMS41533HQZE/edit?usp=sharing}
        {\textcolor{blue}{clang-refactor}}, which later resulted in
        \href{https://clang.llvm.org/docs/RefactoringEngine.html}{\textcolor{blue}{Clang's
        Refactoring Engine}}.
      \item Added new checks to Clang-Tidy and reduced false-positive rate for
        few existing checks.
    \end{itemize}}
  \cventry{2015}{Google Summer of Code student}{LLVM
    Community}{Remote}{}{Implemented Code Clone Detection tool in Clang Static
    Analyzer and used it to detect similar code pieces in Git,
    Vim, OpenSSL and other projects:\@ an overview of key results can be found
    \href{https://github.com/kbobyrev/code-clone-detection-llvm-devmtg15-poster\#code-clone-detection-llvm-devmtg15-poster}{\textcolor{blue}{here}}.}

\section{Projects}

     tooling. This includes contributing to Clangd, Clang-Tidy, Clang Static
     Analyzer and other C++ Language tools.}
  \cventry{2018}{$\texttt{TD}(\gamma)$}{}
    {\url{https://github.com/kbobyrev/td-gamma}}{}
    {Implemented Reinforcement Learning algorithm after the original paper and
     presented a poster showcasing the results. Algorithm's features were
     thoroughly studied and showcased in the
     \href{https://kbobyrev.github.io/resources/TD-Gamma-Poster.pdf}{\textcolor{blue}{poster}}.}
  \cventry{2016}{VisARTM}{}
    {url{https://github.com/kbobyrev/VisARTM}}{}
    {Designed and implemented a tool for visualizing and assessing topic models
     built using
     \href{https://github.com/bigartm/bigartm}{\textcolor{blue}{BigARTM}}.}
