    Implemented Deep Learning models in PyTorch and Tensorflow Computer Vision
    tasks such as Image Classification and Object Segmentation, built Machine

    {Worked on Clangd, Clang-based C++ Language Server Protocol implementation
     used by CLion, XCode, Eclipse, a number of other IDEs and text editor
     plugins
     \begin{itemize}
       \item Designed and implemented
         \href{https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C-A6PGT6TynyaX4PXyExNMiGmJ2jL1UwV91Kyx11gOI/edit?usp=sharing}
         {\textcolor{blue}{Dex}} efficient Clangd symbol index for fuzzy
         matching code completion.
         % TODO: Based on Russ Cox & Google CodeSearch...
       \item Replaced previous Static Index implementation and gained over 15x
         performance boost while providing more features such as advanced
         filtering for code completion-based symbol search.
       \item Reduced code completion symbol search average latency from
         \SI{16}{\mics} to \SI{1.09}{\mics} for LLVM codebase (3M Lines Of
         Code) and from \SI{119}{\mics} to \SI{1.9}{\mics} for Chromium
         codebase (16M LOC).
       \item Implemented Variable length Byte (VByte) compression algorithm and
         reduced memory overhead by 60\%.
       \item Identified performance bottlenecks in commonly used LLVM YAML
         serializer and improved performance by a factor of 3.
     \end{itemize}}

    Worked on Clang-Rename, Clang-based tool for renaming symbols such as
    variables, functions, arguments.

      % TODO: Which issues? Inconsistent renaming...
      % TODO: How did I get new users? Announcements, answers on mailing
      % lists...
      \item Fixed a number of existing issues, introduced new functionality
        and gained users for Clang-Rename.
      \item Built Vim and Emacs plugins for Clang-Rename tool.
      % TODO: Later picked up by Apple's Alex Lorenz....
      \item Designed and prototyped

        \href{https://clang.llvm.org/docs/RefactoringEngine.html}{\textcolor{blue}{Clang's
        Refactoring Engine}}.
      \item Added new checks to Clang-Tidy and reduced false-positive rate for
        few existing checks.
      % TODO: Outlined the necessity of having Language Server which later
      % resulted in Clangd which became the focus of the team.
