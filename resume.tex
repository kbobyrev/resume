    Handl is Y Combinator-backed startup. I implemented Deep Learning models
    in PyTorch and TensorFlow Computer Vision tasks such as Image
    Classification and Object Segmentation, built Machine Learning pipelines
    starting from raw data and producing necessary predictions on par with
    state-of-the-art results.

  \cventry{Jul 2018 - Sep 2018}{Software Engineering Intern}
    {Google}{}{C++ Language Tools Team}
    {Worked on Clangd, Clang-based C++ Language Server Protocol implementation
     used by CLion, XCode, Eclipse, a number of other IDEs and text editor
     plugins
     \begin{itemize}
       \item Designed and implemented

         {\textcolor{blue}{Dex}} --- efficient Clangd symbol index for fuzzy
         matching code completion.
         % TODO: Based on Russ Cox & Google CodeSearch...
       \item Replaced previous Static Index implementation and gained over 15x
         performance boost while providing more features such as advanced
         filtering for code completion-based symbol search.
       \item Reduced code completion symbol search average latency from
         \SI{16}{\mics} to \SI{1.09}{\mics} for LLVM codebase (3M Lines Of
         Code) and from \SI{119}{\mics} to \SI{1.9}{\mics} for Chromium
         codebase (16M LOC).
       \item Implemented Variable length Byte (VByte) compression algorithm and
         reduced memory overhead by 60\%.
       \item Identified performance bottlenecks in commonly used LLVM YAML
         serializer and improved performance by a factor of 3.
     \end{itemize}}
  \cventry{Jun 2016 - Sep 2016}{Software Engineering

    Worked on Clang-Rename, Clang-based tool for renaming symbols such as
    variables, functions, arguments.
    \begin{itemize}
      % TODO: Which issues? Inconsistent renaming...
      % TODO: How did I get new users? Announcements, answers on mailing
      % lists...
      \item Fixed a number of existing issues, introduced new functionality
        and gained users for Clang-Rename.
      \item Built Vim and Emacs plugins for Clang-Rename tool.
      % TODO: Later picked up by Apple's Alex Lorenz....
      \item Designed and prototyped
        \href{https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w9IkR0_Gqmd5w4CZ2t_ZDZrNLYVirQPyMS41533HQZE/edit?usp=sharing}

        \href{https://clang.llvm.org/docs/RefactoringEngine.html}{\textcolor{blue}{Clang's
        Refactoring Engine}}.
      \item Added new checks to Clang-Tidy and reduced false-positive rate for
        few existing checks.
      % TODO: Outlined the necessity of having Language Server which later
      % resulted in Clangd which became the focus of the team.

  \cventry{Jun 2015 - Sep 2015}{Google Summer of Code student}{LLVM
    Community}{Remote}{}{Implemented Code Clone Detection tool in Clang Static
    Analyzer and used it to detect over 400 similar code pieces in Git,
